# parallel-programming-swarm-simulation
This project demonstrates a distributed parallel simulation of a drone swarm exploring a 3D arena. Each drone runs as a separate MPI process, communicating with a central Tower coordinator to synchronize global state, avoid collisions, and track exploration coverage.
